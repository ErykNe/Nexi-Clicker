Nexi Clicker 1.0.0 ©
Made by ErykNe

Formality:
- Autoclicker might be unfair advantage in some games, so you're using it only
at your own resposibility. I am not responsible of how you use it.

For Launching this application you must have:
- Newest Java Oracle or Zulu Platform
- JDK at accurately THIS location: C:\Program Files\All Java Files\JDK
- SDK at accurately THIS location: C:\Program Files\All Java Files\SDK (JavaFX)
This location is required because JavaFX can't work without assigned location,
if you don't want to instal this in that locations, you propably might use 
application with .jar file, which is in ,,src'' folder.

Usage:
- Use in accordance with any steps. If something went wrong or there is a bug, it's
only your fault :)
- If application doesn't work even so you've instaled the above required things, that
might be caused by fact that you aren't launching it at Windows 10 or above.

 
Mode of action:
- While setting you have to confirm everything everytime with pressing enter button.
- If you've set everything correctly, just click the ,,Start clicking'' button (you
also can click both at the same time, system will recognize both hotkeys and both ways to click)
- After that system will register what do you clicking on the keyboard, and if you
click your hotkey button, system clicks exactly the in same interval of CPS that you've set
- To stop the proccess, you have to click your hotkey again or click ,,Stop button'' or even
close the application


Have a great fun
